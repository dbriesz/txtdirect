# Vision

txtdirect is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:

This project thrives to be open, transparent and helpful.


Our detailed items:
* Only specific categories allowed
* Bugfixes only
* For personal projects only



## Core Concept

Example Project&#39;s core concept to showcase how, why it does what it does.




## General Aim

Example Project should only provide a small core and further additions should be done in helper projects/plugins or some sort.



## Communication
A lot of discussion about txtdirect happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until txtdirect becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The txtdirect project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
