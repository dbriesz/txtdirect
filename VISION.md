# Vision
TXTDirect is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
TXTDirect thrives to give back control and data to redirects.

## Core Concept
Instead of relying on external providers to control redirect data. TXTDirect uses data stored within your own DNS records and provides an easily switchable backend service/implementation.

## General Aim
TXTDirect provides the specification for redirection records and a based implementation as caddy plugin.

## Communication
A lot of discussion about TXTDirect happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until TXTDirect becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The TXTDirect project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
